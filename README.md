# EGR 101-Final Project
**"Create Your Future" Final Project 2024**

This project is a simple 2D frog game created in Unity. The player controls a frog that can move and jump. The frog follows the player and responds to input through animations and physics. This game was developed to answer these prompts:

- **What does it mean to you to be a successful engineer in the real world? What is your vision for your professional position upon graduation and then 5 or 10 years beyond that?**
- **Provide a visual "road map" outlining your path to becoming a successful engineer.**
    
This game serves as a visual roadmap of my engineering journey. The player controls a frog that moves and overcomes obstacles, which is symbolic of the challenges and growth I expect in my engineering career.

## Acknowledgments:
I want to thank the University of Kentucky's Women's Association of Commuting Machinery for hosting an AMAZING half-hackathon (my first ever) and my team for helping me learn so much. Without them, I wouldn't have had the means or creativity to attempt this project, allowing me to actually enjoy developing it using a language and software I didn't know prior.

## Features:
- **Movement**: The frog can move left and right using arrow keys.
- **Jumping**: The frog can jump when the spacebar is pressed.
- **Animations**: The frog has different animations for moving/jumping and idle.
- **Bug Follower**: A bug friend follows the frog, flipping in the frog's direction.
